    <h1>Introduction TO HTML</h1>
    <p>The Lego Story is a 2012 Danish animated short film directed by Kim Pagel. The 17-minute animation was produced
        by Kim
        Pagel and The LEGO Group to celebrate its 80th anniversary. </p>
    <p>The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words “leg godt”, meaning “play well”. It's our name and
        it's our
        ideal. The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen. The company has since passed from generation
        to
        generation and is to this day still owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family.</p>
